This is a description of what each visual measures. The red text is used to show how to interact with the dashboard

#### Return Rates By Quarter Line Graph

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f4e56d1-5b8e-4351-9ee5-acb9228b96c5)

This line graph shows the return rates of these following states by quarter:

1. Utah
2. Massachusetts
3. Tennessee
4. Oregon
5. Washington
6. New York
7. Delaware
8. California
9. Mississippi
10. Colorado

##### Utah, Colorado, Oregon, and Massachusetts were states with consistent high return rates each year
##### Utah and Mississippi were the only two states with a 100% return rate
##### The other states had mostly low to mid range return rates
##### Quarters' 3 and 4 saw the highest return rates - might have to do with the holiday season

#### Return Rates By Product Category

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9652f9fe-70bb-4d11-88d9-d0ad1285110d)

From highest to lowest, this bar chart shows the return rates for product categories. They are:
1. Technology has the highest overall return rate at 27.3%
3. Office Supplies has the middle overall return rate at 25.68%
4. Furniture has the lowest overall return rate at 25.6%

##### Since people use technological items every day, it stands to reason that they would be the pickiest about what kinds of tech that works for them and what they like.

#### Total Sales by Total Returns Scatterplot for Sub-Categories
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9dfa864-3db3-449d-b73f-98b0120f08a0)
This scatterplot shows the relationship between total sales and the total return rate. This chart is filtered by the sub-categories with the highest sales and return rates

##### The sub-categories with the most sales and highest return rates are:
1. Binders
2. Paper
3. Furnishings
4. Phones
5. Storage
6. Accessories
7. Chairs
##### Art is the only sub-category that has high sales and a low return rate. When people buy art, they're very selective on what they want to buy because they don't want to go through the hassle of bringing it back.
##### All other sub-categories fall below the average line for both metrics. My thinking is that they are non essential items that people only go out and buy once they need them. Most are an after thought. 


#### Return Rates by Customer

#### Return Rate By Sub-Category
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5090a14-b169-42f2-863c-7f2fa155dd65)
This bar chart shows the sub-categories with the highest return rate

The top 5 sub-categories by return rate are:
1. Machines - 35%
2. Fasteners - 32.2%
3. Chairs - 29.6%
4. Appliances - 29.3%
5. Tables - 28.6%

##### Machines fall under the Technology category so it makes sense they have the highest return rate.
