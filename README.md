**Note: Central Region is colored blue, East Region is orange, South Region is red, West Region is green**

1. The Central Region shows the most loss. This tells me they need to rethink their advertising strategy
- Binders have a net loss of $20,585
- Tables have a net loss of $4,162
- Furnshings have a net loss of $3,950
- Appliances have a net loss of $3,288
- Bookcases have a neet loss of $2,021
- Machines have a net loss of $1,443
- Supplies have a net loss of $2,021
2. The Tables Sub-Category has the most loss across all regions - tells me that not many people have need of Tables in the data's date range
3. Copiers have the highest net gain across all regions. This tells us that office spaces around the US are in constant need of copiers, which explains why Paper has a fairly even distribution.
4. Copiers and Binders have the most distribution across all regions
5. Fasteners have the lowest net gain across all regions barely passing $1000. This tells me they should readjust their advertising strategy to push towards construnction demographic.
6. The West region is the only region with net gains in all sub-categories. This tells me that they have the best luck in advertising.
