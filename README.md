#### Best Restaurants By Revenue

##### This bar chart shows the restaurants and restaurant chains that have the most revenue in rupees

The top 5 restaurants by revenue are:
1. Dominos - 5,030,551 rupees
2. McDonald's - 2,989,048 rupees
3. Pizza Hut - 2,066,937 rupees
4. Kouzina Kafe - The Food Court - 1,958,408 rupees
5. Sweet Truth - Cake and Desserts - 1,952,881 rupees

- This chart shows that people in India are willing to spend more at chain restaurants than other restaurants. 

#### Total Ratings By Gender
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdf717ae-4a6d-4349-acb1-7dd1f70c7998)

##### This bar chart shows the total ratings given by men and women
**For Men**: 57,218 (57%) total rating
**For Women**: 42,782 (42%) total ratings

This shows that men are more inclined to leave a review for a restaurant.

#### Distribution of Different Rating Counts
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de9d827c-6e23-4c28-b339-a454fede26cb)

##### This pie chart shows the distribution of different rating counts. Those include
1. Too Few Ratings - 58.61%, 87,014 total ratings
2. 20+ Ratings - 14.57%, 21,636 total ratings
3. 50+ Ratings - 8.09%, 12,009 total ratings
4. 100+ Ratings - 13.84%, 20,548 total ratings
5. 500+ Ratings - 2.96%, 4,396 total ratings
6. 1K+ Ratings - 1.85%, 2,739 total ratings
7. 5K+ Ratings - 0.07%, 98 total ratings
8. 10K+ Ratings - <0.01%

- Most restaurants listed in the dataset are those that aren't chains like Dominos or McDonald's. They are more like small mom and pop restaurants that don't generate a ton of revenue, which can be caused by too few ratings

#### Scatterplot of Revenue by Order Volume
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36ee9323-7092-43fe-985d-cc570b98ef02)
##### This scatterplot shows the correlation of restaurants' revenue vs. their order volume. This scatterplot has been filtered to only show restaurants that made more than 1,000,000 in rupees. The restaurants listed below are restaurants that fall below or above the average lines of both metrics.

##### The top 5 restaurants with a high sales revenue and a high order count are:
1. Dominos
2. Pizza Hut
3. McDonald's
4. KFC
5. Baskin Robbins

###### The top 5 restaurants on the lower end of sales revenue and order count aree:

1. Five Star Chicken
2. Burger It Up
3. Much Marsala
4. Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters
5. Slay Coffee

#### Total Restaurant Popularity By Cost and Total Ratings
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a38fdc3e-479d-4354-8a21-89b329611569)

##### This bar graph shows how many ratings were given to restaurants based on how much they charge for food. 

In this graph, it's shown that people like restaurants where the cost is 200 rupees, which is $2.34 US dollars. This leads me to believe that people are more likely to go and purchase cheaper food. Sometimes the food can be better, or they want to go to a restaurant chain like McDonald's.

#### Map of Order Volume in Neighborhoods
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc41542c-76ff-4d10-b2ca-01a4957210e1)
##### This is a map view of restaurant counts in localities in India. The bigger circles are associated with localities that have a higher restaurant popularity than others

##### The top 5 localities with high restaurant counts are:

1. Bikaner
2. Noida
3. Indirapuram, Delhi
4. BTM, Bangalore
5. Rohini, Delhi

#### Box Plot of Rating Counts By Order Volume
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96a9f01e-9bfa-4c5d-9e12-2b6a84f760f8)
##### This is a box plot showing the distribution of rating counts by order volume, revenue, and dining category

###### Restaurants with Too Few Ratings make up the bulk of the distribution.
1. North Indian is the top grossing dining category at 89,082,807 rupees with 12,996 orders
2. Chinese is the second highest grossing dining category at 68,276,139 rupees with 12,438 orders
3. Indian is the third highest grossing dining category at 64,582,445 rupees with 11,304 orders
4. All the other dining categories have made below 35,000,000 rupees in revenue and have less than 6,000 orders

#### Dining Categories with the Highest Revenue
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd43e3f6-1aeb-4c92-a941-8e3d330d41b0)
##### This bar graph shows the dining categories that have earned the highest revenue. This chart has been filtered to show dining categories that have generated more than 1,000,000 rupees overall.

###### The top 5 dining categories by total revenue across all restaurants are:

1. North Indian - 162,611,730 rupees
2. Chinese - 110,147,863 rupees
3. Indian - 104,124,472 rupees
4. Biryani - 65,889,740 rupees
5. South Indian - 59,378,590 rupees

4 out of 5 dining categories in the top 5 are Indian. However, Chinese food comes second. I believe this might be correlated with how India has had a long, extensive history with Chinese food so the people there like it. 

### In my closing paragraph, I provided some recommendations for restaurants on how to move forward.

There are over 100,000 restaurants that are available in the Zomato database, however only a fourth of those restaurants and restaurant chains offer sustainable data to compile a report. The best way to move forward is to focus on those restaurants that don’t have much of a footprint, socially and economically speaking. In other words, working towards improving the standings of those restaurants that don’t have many ratings despite being in high populated places will yield positive results. For restaurant chains, the best way for them to move forward is to alter their menus to be more locally friendly. India is a country made up of different districts with dozens of different languages, dialects, and sub-cultures. Understanding what these people enjoy to eat will help grow all restaurants financially in the future.
