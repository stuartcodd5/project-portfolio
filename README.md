##### Review Counts with the Highest Average Ratings
- We can see that the bulk of total reviews had an average rating of 3.8 to 4.8.
- Reviews that included a rating of 4.9 totaled the most at 10,848 reviews.
- Reviews that inlcuded a rating of 3.2 totaled the least at 456 reviews.
- In general, apps on Shopify have a mid to high rating score with a high number of reviews to back it up.

##### Highest Modified Review Count based on Date
- This line graph shows the trend of modified reviews from May to June and how the trend fluctuates in the middle of May
- After Monday, May 9, 2022, modified reviews made a steep fall until the next day on May 10, 2022 when they stopped at 4734 reviews
- On Wednesday, May 18, 2022, the modified reviews rose up to 25,534 before falling back down again to 1142 modified reviews on Saturday, May 21, 2022.
- The modified reviews didn't reach a high again until Monday, May 30, 2022, when reviews totaled 28,597
- After that, modified reviews tried to push up again but only made it to 24,630 reviews on Thursday, June 2, 2022
- From this line chart, we can see that users tend to leave modified reviews early in the week And at the beginning of each month.

- From the scatterplot, we can see that reviews that had left a review of 4.48 were more likely to be answered by developers.
- This leads me to believe that developers want to get their apps rated at a 4.5 or above.
